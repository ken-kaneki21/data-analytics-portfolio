## Experiment Setup
- Variant A: Control group
- Variant B: Test group
- Metric: Conversion Rate

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Excel

## Analysis Performed
- Data validation and cleaning
- Conversion rate comparison
- Hypothesis testing (two-sample test)
- Confidence interval estimation

## Decision
The results were used to determine whether Version B should be rolled out or rejected based on statistical significance.
