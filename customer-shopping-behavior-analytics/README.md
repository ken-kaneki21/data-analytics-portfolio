# Customer Shopping Behavior Analytics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using transactional data to understand purchasing patterns, repeat behavior, and factors influencing buying decisions. The goal is to generate actionable insights that can support customer engagement, marketing strategy, and business decision-making.

The analysis combines SQL, Python, and Power BI to move from raw transaction data to insights and visual storytelling.

---

## Project Objectives
- Analyze customer purchasing patterns and transaction behavior
- Identify repeat vs one-time customers
- Evaluate the impact of discounts, seasonality, and channels on buying decisions
- Generate data-driven recommendations to improve customer engagement

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains transaction-level customer shopping data, including:
- Customer identifiers
- Transaction dates
- Purchase amounts
- Discount information
- Channel details (online/offline where applicable)

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL:** Querying and aggregating transactional data
- **Python:** Data cleaning, analysis, and exploratory insights
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and visual analysis
- **Excel / PowerPoint:** Supporting analysis and insight presentation
- **GitHub:** Version control and project documentation

---

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Customer segmentation (repeat vs one-time buyers)
- Transaction frequency and spend analysis
- Discount and seasonal impact analysis
- Channel-based behavior comparison
- Visualization of key customer metrics

---

## Key Insights
- A relatively small group of repeat customers contributes a significant portion of total revenue
- Discounts influence purchase frequency but do not always increase overall spend
- Clear seasonal trends are visible in customer purchasing behavior
- Customer engagement differs across purchasing channels

---

## Business Recommendations
- Focus retention strategies on high-value repeat customers
- Use targeted discounts instead of broad discounting campaigns
- Align marketing efforts with seasonal demand patterns
- Optimize channel-specific engagement strategies
